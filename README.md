# Game of Three

Consists of Server program and the client program

1. game-of-three (server)
2. game-of-three-client (client)

This game can be run in both auto mode and manual mode.  In order to run in manual mode, run the game-of-three-client with "true" as a run time program argument.

## STEPS
1. Run game-of-three (server) first.
2. Run game-of-three-client two times, one program for each player.
3. If a client is run in manual mode, input consol values to continue with the game.

## Note:
1. Please note though the program is designed for more than 2 players, it is not tested with more than 2 players.
2. There is scope for further improvisation as currently the client program checks the server for status.  Instead we can make the server notify the client for any status change.
